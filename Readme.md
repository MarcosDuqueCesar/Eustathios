***This is a work in progress.***  This design was based off of Tim Rastall's ["Ingentis"](https://www.youmagine.com/designs/ingentis-a-tantillus-variant) build.  Most parts have been either edited or completly reworked.  However props to Tim!


### Features
1.  Aluminum extrusion frame.
2.  Belt driven design with dual Z leadscrews.
3.  Custom hotend carriage with integrated fan ducts.
4.  300mmx300mmx300mm build volume.
5.  Super awesome!
